# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Programs Used:
    * pgAdmin
    * Microsoft Excel
## Purpose
While working with data for the company Pewlett-Hackard, the company had asked us to create tables of the people working for them who may be eligibale for retirement. After parsing through the data the first time we were then tasked to create a more concise list. Many people have had different titles due to promotions over the years. Using pgAdmin and SQl we were able to create new tables and concvert them into Microspft Excel sheets to be viewed by managment at Pewlett-Hackard.

## Results
    * The department with the most people eligible for retirement is the Development department, which can be seen in the retirement_by_department.png. With that being said, the Development department would benefit the most to begin to look for new talent with 9281 employees in retirement eligible age. Production is a close second with 8174 people.
    * The highest paid retirement age employee is Reghbati Toshimo who is salaried at $124,357 (see retirement_salaries.csv in the Data folder for more info)
    * Based on the retiring_titles.png we can see that the most common position held by retirement age employees is Senior Engineer with 29,414 people.
    * Moreover, by combining the number of higher level positions we can see that 62,172 of the retirement age employees are in senior/leadership positions while 28,226 employees in that age range are in regular staff positions.
## Summary
As you can see by the retiring_titles.png in the Pewlett-Hackard folder there are 90,398 people eligible for retiriment, most of them Senior Engineers. There are a total of 300,024 total employees working for Pewlett-Hackard, meaning approximately 30% of the staff will be retiring soon. That being said, based on parameters given for what a mentor could be, current employees born between January 1st, 1965 and December 31st, 1965, there are a total of 1,549 people who meet the requirements to become mentors (see mentorship_eligibility.csv). That means for every 1 mentor there will be about 58 new employees to be mentored. Pewlett-Hackard may want to expand the parameters of who can be a mentor to accomodate the infulx of new employees. 
It would be worth inspecting exactly which departments are losing the most senior positions. Knowing this information could help those departments prepare for the transition and begin training the potential employees getting promoted. This way when the time comes when these retirement age people begin to leave the new management is available to take their position. As a company, Pewlett-Hackard will have to look at what it's retirement policy is (healthcare, pension, 401k, etc) and what that means when over 90,000 people retire around the same time. Additionally, this may affect how they higher the next wave of people and what kind of benefits they offer these new hires.
